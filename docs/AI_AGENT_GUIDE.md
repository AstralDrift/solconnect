## üìö Universal Prompt Templates

The repository includes AI-optimized prompt templates at `ai-agent-heaven-universal/core/templates/universal-prompts.yaml`:

### Feature Implementation Template
```yaml
implement_feature:
  claude_enhancement: |
    Use your parallel processing capabilities to:
    - Analyze multiple implementation approaches simultaneously
    - Consider various edge cases and error scenarios in parallel
    - Generate comprehensive test cases covering all aspects
    - Validate architectural impact across multiple system components
```

### Debugging Template
```yaml
debug_issue:
  gpt4_enhancement: |
    Use conversational debugging approach:
    - Walk through the issue step-by-step
    - Explain your reasoning for each hypothesis
    - Validate assumptions before implementing fixes
```

## üß† Intelligence Amplification Features

### Context Engine
The repository automatically provides relevant context based on your task:

```typescript
// Context is automatically optimized for your agent type and task
const context = await contextEngine.amplifyContext(agentType, task);
// Returns prioritized files, patterns, and guidance specific to your capabilities
```

### Predictive Assistance
```typescript
// AI predicts what you'll need next based on historical patterns
const predictions = await predictiveEngine.predictAgentNeeds(agentType, context);
// Includes: likely next steps, potential issues, resource recommendations
```

### Cross-Agent Knowledge Sharing
```typescript
// Knowledge learned by one agent type is shared with relevant others
await knowledgeNetwork.shareKnowledge(sourceAgent, knowledge);
// Automatically adapts knowledge for different agent specializations
```

## üîÑ Self-Improving Systems
