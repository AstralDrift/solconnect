# Mobile UI/UX Audit Report

This document summarizes the current state of SolConnect's mobile applications and proposes improvements for a unified cross‑platform experience.

## Existing Implementations

- **`apps/solchat_mobile`** – Expo based React Native app written in TypeScript. Contains screens for login, chat list and chat threads with a mock SDK.
- **`mobile/app`** – Standalone React Native project written in JavaScript with similar screens and Solana Web3 examples.
- **`encrypted-chat`** – Starter Expo project with minimal demo content and no integration with the rest of the codebase.

## Gaps Identified

1. **Duplicated code bases** – Three separate apps implement similar functionality with different stacks and inconsistent styling.
2. **No shared component library** – Each app defines its own UI components and styles leading to diverging look and feel.
3. **Missing mobile features** – Push notifications, biometric authentication and background sync are absent.
4. **Performance concerns** – Logging in production increases bundle size and there is no optimization of the startup path.
5. **Testing coverage** – No automated tests exist for mobile features.

## Proposed Improvements

1. **Unify projects** under the `solchat_mobile` app using Expo and TypeScript while extracting a reusable component library.
2. **Introduce cross‑platform components** that can be shared with future web builds, enabling consistent design and faster iteration.
3. **Add mobile‑first features** such as push notification registration and biometric login using Expo SDKs.
4. **Optimize production builds** with Babel plugins to strip debug logs and lazy load heavy modules when possible.
5. **Create a testing suite** using `jest-expo` and `react-native-testing-library` to cover login flows and SDK interactions.
