# Mobile UI/UX Audit Report

This report summarizes the current state of the SolConnect mobile experience and proposes improvements.

## Observed Gaps

- Duplicate implementations between `apps/solchat_mobile` and `mobile/app` made it difficult to maintain a consistent experience.
- No unified component system. Each project defined its own buttons and inputs.
- Lack of mobile–first features such as push notifications or biometric authentication.
- Background operations were handled on the UI thread leading to potential sluggishness.

## Proposed Improvements

1. **Cross‑Platform Component Library** – Introduce a shared library of components and hooks so mobile and web builds use the same primitives.
2. **Biometric Authentication & Push Notifications** – Utilize Expo SDK to integrate device features, improving security and engagement.
3. **Background Sync** – Register periodic background tasks to fetch new messages while the app is not active.
4. **Testing Suite** – Add Jest configuration with React Native Testing Library for mobile code.

These changes form the foundation for a smoother, unified experience across iOS, Android and the web.
