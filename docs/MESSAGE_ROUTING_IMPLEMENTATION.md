# Message Routing Implementation in SolConnect Relay

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of message routing functionality in the SolConnect QUIC relay server. Previously, the relay server only acknowledged messages without actually routing them to recipients. This implementation adds full message routing capabilities with support for offline message queueing.

## Problem Statement

The relay server had TODOs in the code indicating that message routing was not implemented:
- Messages were only acknowledged but not forwarded to recipients
- No support for offline recipients
- No connection management for wallet addresses

## Solution

### 1. Router Module (`relay/solchat_relay/src/router.rs`)

Created a new `MessageRouter` struct that handles:
- **Connection Management**: Maps wallet addresses to active connections
- **Message Routing**: Routes messages to online recipients in real-time
- **Message Queueing**: Queues messages for offline recipients (up to 100 messages per recipient)
- **Automatic Delivery**: Delivers queued messages when recipients come online

Key features:
- Thread-safe implementation using `Arc<RwLock<HashMap>>`
- Channel-based communication for sending messages to clients
- Metrics integration for monitoring

### 2. Protocol Extensions

Added handshake messages to the protocol buffer schema:
- `HandshakeRequest`: For client authentication with wallet signature
- `HandshakeResponse`: Server response to handshake

### 3. Main Server Integration

Updated the relay server to:
- Create message routing channels for each connection
- Handle bidirectional communication (incoming and outgoing messages)
- Register clients with the router when they send messages
- Route messages through the router instead of just acknowledging them

### 4. Metrics

Added new metrics for monitoring:
- `solchat_messages_routed_total`: Total messages successfully routed
- `solchat_messages_queued_total`: Total messages queued for offline recipients
- `solchat_registered_clients`: Current number of registered clients
- `solchat_queued_messages`: Current number of queued messages

## Architecture

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   Client A  │────▶│ QUIC Relay   │────▶│   Client B  │
└─────────────┘     │   Server     │     └─────────────┘
                    │              │
                    │  ┌────────┐  │
                    │  │ Router │  │
                    │  │        │  │
                    │  │ Queue  │  │
                    │  └────────┘  │
                    └──────────────┘
```

## Usage

When a client connects and sends a message:
1. The relay server registers the client's wallet address
2. Messages are routed based on the recipient's wallet address
3. If the recipient is online, the message is delivered immediately
4. If the recipient is offline, the message is queued
5. When the recipient comes online, queued messages are delivered

## Testing

Created comprehensive integration tests in `relay/solchat_relay/tests/routing_test.rs`:
- Test message routing between online clients
- Test message queueing for offline recipients
- Test delivery of multiple queued messages

## Future Enhancements

1. **Persistent Storage**: Currently, queued messages are only stored in memory. Adding persistent storage would survive server restarts.

2. **Message Expiration**: Implement TTL-based message expiration for queued messages.

3. **Signature Verification**: The TODO for signature verification is still pending and should be implemented for security.

4. **Proper Authentication**: Implement the handshake protocol for proper client authentication during connection setup.

5. **Clustering**: Support for multiple relay servers with shared message queues.

## Code Changes Summary

- Created `relay/solchat_relay/src/router.rs` with complete routing implementation
- Updated `relay/solchat_relay/src/main.rs` to integrate the router
- Extended `relay/solchat_relay/src/metrics.rs` with routing metrics
- Added handshake messages to `core/solchat_protocol/proto/message.proto`
- Created integration tests in `relay/solchat_relay/tests/routing_test.rs`

The implementation successfully addresses the TODO comments and provides a robust message routing system for the SolConnect relay server.
