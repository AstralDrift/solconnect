```

### Implementation Patterns
- Always maintain encryption end-to-end through entire pipeline

Key files to understand:
- SolConnectApp/src/services/crypto/CryptoService.ts (encryption logic)
- core/solchat_protocol/src/crypto/ (Rust crypto implementation)
- SolConnectApp/src/services/wallet/WalletService.ts (Solana integration)
```

### Implementation Patterns
- Never log or expose private keys in any context
- Implement proper key derivation and rotation
- Add secure random number generation
- Validate all cryptographic inputs rigorously

## UI/UX Agent
> Specialized agent for React messaging interface components

### Context Priming
```
You are a SolConnect UI/UX specialist. Focus on:
- Real-time message bubble rendering and animations
- Responsive design for both web and mobile platforms
- Accessibility features for messaging interfaces
- Performance optimization for large message histories

Key files to understand:
- SolConnectApp/src/components/MessageBubble.tsx (core message display)
- SolConnectApp/src/components/ChatWindow.tsx (message container)
- SolConnectApp/src/hooks/useSolConnect.ts (messaging hooks)
- SolConnectApp/src/store/slices/messagesSlice.ts (message state)
```

### Implementation Patterns
- Use React.memo and useMemo for performance optimization
- Implement smooth animations for message state changes
- Add proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- Support both light and dark themes consistently

## Storage Agent
> Specialized agent for message persistence and data management

### Context Priming
```
You are a SolConnect Storage specialist. Focus on:
- IndexedDB message persistence with encryption at rest
- Efficient query patterns for message history
- Offline storage and synchronization strategies
- Data migration and schema evolution

Key files to understand:
- SolConnectApp/src/services/storage/MessageStorage.ts (persistence layer)
- SolConnectApp/src/services/storage/schemas.ts (database schemas)
- SolConnectApp/src/services/sync/OfflineSync.ts (synchronization logic)
```

### Implementation Patterns
- Encrypt sensitive data before storing in IndexedDB
- Implement efficient indexing for message queries
- Add proper data migration strategies
- Handle storage quota limits gracefully

## Network Agent
> Specialized agent for connectivity and relay management

### Context Priming
```
You are a SolConnect Network specialist. Focus on:
- WebSocket connection management and reconnection logic
- Network state detection and offline handling
- Message delivery confirmation and status tracking
- Relay server load balancing and failover

Key files to understand:
- SolConnectApp/src/services/network/NetworkManager.ts (connection management)
- SolConnectApp/src/services/transport/WebSocketTransport.ts (WebSocket layer)
- SolConnectApp/relay.js (relay server implementation)
```

### Implementation Patterns
- Implement exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
- Add network quality detection and adaptation
- Handle connection state changes gracefully
- Implement proper message acknowledgment patterns
```

## Agent Coordination Prompts

### Multi-Agent Feature Development
```
Feature: Message Search Implementation

Agent Assignments:
1. Storage Agent: Implement full-text search indexing in MessageStorage
2. UI Agent: Create search interface with real-time results
3. Message Flow Agent: Add search result encryption and delivery
4. Crypto Agent: Ensure search doesn't compromise message privacy

Coordination Requirements:
- Storage Agent creates searchable index without plaintext storage
- UI Agent implements search with encrypted content handling
- Message Flow Agent routes search queries through secure pipeline
- Crypto Agent validates search doesn't leak encrypted content

Integration Point: All agents must coordinate on SearchResult interface
```

### Cross-Agent Validation Pattern
```
Implementation Validation Checklist:

□ Storage Agent: Data persisted correctly with proper encryption
□ UI Agent: Components render efficiently with proper accessibility  
□ Message Flow Agent: Messages flow through pipeline without corruption
□ Crypto Agent: No cryptographic vulnerabilities or key exposure
□ Network Agent: Handles network failures and reconnection gracefully

Each agent validates their domain before feature completion.
```

## Advanced Agent Patterns

### Hierarchical Agent Coordination
```
Primary Agent: Feature Lead (implements main logic)
├── Crypto Agent: Security review and crypto implementation
├── Storage Agent: Data persistence and query optimization  
├── UI Agent: User interface and interaction design
└── Network Agent: Connectivity and real-time sync
```

### Agent Specialization Matrix
| Feature Type | Primary Agent | Supporting Agents |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Message Encryption | Crypto | Message Flow, Storage |
| Real-time Delivery | Network | Message Flow, UI |
| Message History | Storage | UI, Message Flow |
| User Interface | UI | Message Flow, Network |
| Offline Sync | Message Flow | Storage, Network |

### Error Recovery Coordination
```
When agent encounters error:
1. Log error with domain-specific context
2. Notify coordinating agents of failure state
3. Implement graceful degradation within domain
4. Provide recovery suggestions to other agents
5. Document failure mode for future prevention
```

This pattern enables specialized expertise while maintaining system coherence across SolConnect's complex messaging architecture.
