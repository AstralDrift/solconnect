*Generated by AI Agent Heaven Framework*

## Feature Description Analysis
"Implement intelligent relay server selection and failover with connection quality monitoring, load balancing, and seamless failover handling"

## Component Impact Analysis
- **Network Layer**: HIGH (relay discovery, connection monitoring, failover logic)
- **Transport Layer**: HIGH (WebSocket connection management, reconnection handling)
- **Monitoring Layer**: HIGH (connection metrics, health monitoring, alerting)
- **Service Layer**: MEDIUM (integration with existing MessageBus and transport)
- **Storage Layer**: MEDIUM (relay configuration, connection history)
- **UI Layer**: LOW (connection status indicators, settings)

## Complexity Score Calculation
- Base complexity: 6 affected components Ã— 10 = 60 points
- Network topology complexity: +25 (multiple relay discovery and selection)
- Real-time monitoring: +20 (connection quality metrics, latency monitoring)
- Failover logic complexity: +20 (seamless switching, state preservation)
- Load balancing algorithms: +15 (intelligent relay selection)

**Total Complexity Score: 140/200 (COMPLEX)**
