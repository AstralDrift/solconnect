## 🎯 Quick Start for Claude Sessions

1. **Generate Full Context**
   ```bash
   .context/scripts/generate-context.sh
   ```
   This creates both `CONTEXT_SUMMARY.md` and `CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md`

2. **Check Code Health**
   ```bash
   .context/scripts/code-health-check.sh
   ```
   Get a health score and actionable recommendations

3. **Analyze Specific Area**
   ```bash
   .context/scripts/analyze-subsystem.sh services
   ```
   Deep dive into a specific subsystem

4. **Find Related Files**
   ```bash
   .context/scripts/find-related.sh MessageBus
   ```
   Discover all files related to a component

## 📊 Key Metrics Tracked

### Code Health Score (0-100)
- **80-100**: Excellent - Ready for production
- **60-79**: Good - Minor improvements needed
- **40-59**: Needs Attention - Several issues to address
- **0-39**: Critical - Major refactoring required

### Factors Affecting Score:
- TypeScript errors (-5 points each)
- Security vulnerabilities (-10 points each)
- TODO/FIXME items (-1 point per 5 items)
- Test coverage (penalties below 80%)

## 🔧 Script Usage

### `generate-context.sh`
Generates comprehensive context including:
- Git status and recent commits
- TypeScript analysis
- Security audit
- Code metrics (LOC, file counts)
- Complex file detection
- TODO/FIXME analysis
- Test coverage summary
- Performance hints

### `analyze-dependencies.sh`
Provides:
- Direct and dev dependencies listing
- Outdated package detection
- Import frequency analysis
- Circular dependency detection
- Bundle size impact
- Security vulnerability summary

### `code-health-check.sh`
Analyzes:
- Overall health score
- Code complexity metrics
- Large file detection
- Import health
- Documentation coverage
- Test coverage gaps
- Performance opportunities

### `analyze-subsystem.sh <subsystem>`
Available subsystems:
- `services` - Core business logic
- `screens` - UI screens
- `components` - Reusable UI
- `store` - State management
- `hooks` - React hooks
- `transport` - Network layer
- `storage` - Persistence layer

### `find-related.sh <search-term>`
Discovers:
- Direct file matches
- Import/export relationships
- Usage patterns
- Test coverage
- Dependency visualization

## 💡 Best Practices for Claude

1. **Start Each Session**
   - Run `generate-context.sh` first
   - Review `CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md` for project-specific guidance
   - Check `current-work.md` for active tasks

2. **During Development**
   - Use `find-related.sh` before making changes
   - Run `analyze-subsystem.sh` for deep understanding
   - Check `code-patterns.md` for conventions

3. **Before Committing**
   - Run `code-health-check.sh`
   - Update `current-work.md`
   - Document decisions in `decision-log.md`

## 🤖 Claude-Specific Features

### Context Optimization
- Formatted for Claude's parsing
- Includes project constraints
- Communication style preferences
- Common task workflows

### Intelligent Summaries
- Prioritizes actionable information
- Groups related issues
- Provides fix commands
- Tracks progress metrics

### Dependency Mapping
- Visual representations (Mermaid)
- Import/export analysis
- Circular dependency detection
- Bundle impact assessment

## 📈 Tracking Progress

The system tracks:
- Health score trends
- TypeScript error count
- Security vulnerabilities
- Test coverage
- TODO/FIXME items
- Code complexity

## 🔄 Maintenance

### Daily
- Run `generate-context.sh` at session start
- Update `current-work.md` at session end

### Weekly
- Run `code-health-check.sh`
- Review `analyze-dependencies.sh` output
- Clean up completed TODOs

### Monthly
- Review `decision-log.md`
- Update `architecture-map.md`
- Refactor based on complexity analysis

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Scripts Not Running
```bash
chmod +x .context/scripts/*.sh
```

### Missing Dependencies
```bash
# Install jq for JSON parsing
brew install jq

# Install tree for directory visualization
brew install tree
```

### Performance Issues
- Limit search depth in large codebases
- Use subsystem analysis for focused work
- Cache results for repeated queries
