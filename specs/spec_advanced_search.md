# Advanced Message Search with Encryption Privacy
> Implement comprehensive message search while maintaining end-to-end encryption privacy

## High-Level Objective
- Build advanced search functionality that enables full-text message search across chat history while preserving end-to-end encryption and user privacy

## Mid-Level Objectives
- Implement client-side encrypted search index that doesn't expose plaintext content
- Add advanced search filters (date range, sender, message type, media attachments)
- Create responsive search UI with real-time suggestions and result highlighting
- Integrate search with offline message storage and cross-device synchronization
- Add search performance optimization for large message histories (>10K messages)

## SolConnect Architecture Context

### Message Flow Integration
- **Encryption Layer**: Search index must be encrypted at rest, search queries encrypted in transit
- **Transport Layer**: Search results delivered through standard encrypted message pipeline
- **Storage Layer**: Encrypted search index stored in IndexedDB alongside message data
- **Blockchain Layer**: Optional: Store search index hashes on-chain for integrity verification

### Component Integration Points
- **SolConnectSDK**: Add search methods to main API surface
- **MessageBus**: Route search events and result streaming
- **UI Components**: New SearchBar, SearchResults, SearchFilters components
- **State Management**: Add search state to Redux store with caching

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Requirements
- **Privacy**: Search never exposes plaintext message content to storage or network
- **Performance**: Sub-500ms search response time for queries across 10K+ messages
- **Offline Support**: Search works fully offline using local encrypted index
- **Cross-Platform**: Consistent search experience across web and mobile
- **Security**: Search queries and results encrypted end-to-end like regular messages

### SolConnect Conventions
- Follow Result<T> pattern for search operations with proper error handling
- Use SearchQuery and SearchResult interfaces in `src/types/search.ts`
- Implement proper debug logging with `solconnect:search` namespace
- Add comprehensive test coverage including edge cases and performance tests
- Update MessageBus event types for search-related events

### Dependencies & Compatibility
- **Search Library**: Consider using Fuse.js or Lunr.js for fuzzy search capabilities
- **Web Workers**: Use Web Workers for search indexing to avoid UI blocking
- **IndexedDB**: Add search index tables with proper compound indexes
- **Encryption**: Extend existing crypto service for search-specific encryption
